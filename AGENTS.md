# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Family Moments is an Android app that helps families spark meaningful conversations by presenting randomized, swipeable conversation-starter questions in categories like Ice Breakers, Memories, Values, Future Dreams, and Daily Life.

- **Package:** `org.neteinstein.family`
- **Language:** Kotlin, UI in Jetpack Compose + Material3
- **minSdk 32 / targetSdk 37 / compileSdk 37** (see `app/build.gradle.kts` and per-module `build.gradle.kts`)

## Commands

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug                  # compile (mirrors CI "Compile" job)
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest              # run all unit tests (mirrors CI "Unit Tests" job)
./gradlew createDebugUnitTestCoverageReport  # run tests + generate AGP built-in coverage reports (mirrors CI "Code Coverage" job)
```

Run tests for a single module:
```bash
./gradlew :feature:home:testDebugUnitTest
./gradlew :core:domain:testDebugUnitTest
```

Run a single test class or method (`--tests` works with any of the module targets above):
```bash
./gradlew :feature:home:testDebugUnitTest --tests "org.neteinstein.family.feature.home.HomeViewModelTest"
./gradlew :feature:home:testDebugUnitTest --tests "*.HomeViewModelTest.nextQuestion advances to next question"
```

`./gradlew ktlintCheck` runs the [ktlint Gradle plugin](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/ktlint-gradle) (applied per-module, configured in each module's `build.gradle.kts` + root `.editorconfig`) — the formatting/style gate CI relies on. Run `./gradlew ktlintFormat` to auto-fix violations.

CI (`.github/workflows/pr.yml`) runs four independent jobs on every PR into `main`/`develop`: `ktlint`, `assembleDebug`, `testDebugUnitTest`, and `createDebugUnitTestCoverageReport` (coverage report uploaded to Codecov). Coverage comes from AGP's built-in `enableUnitTestCoverage = true` (set per-module in `buildTypes { debug { ... } }`) — there is no separate Jacoco plugin applied.

## Releases

Pushing to `main` (or a manual `workflow_dispatch`) triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which runs `ktlintCheck` + `testDebugUnitTest`, builds a signed `assembleRelease` APK, and publishes it as a GitHub Release tagged `v1.0.<run number>`. Signing requires four repo secrets: `KEYSTORE_BASE64` (base64-encoded `.jks`/`.keystore` file), `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, `KEY_PASSWORD`. The workflow fails fast if any are missing. `app/build.gradle.kts`'s `versionCode`/`versionName` and `signingConfigs["release"]` read `APP_VERSION_CODE`/`APP_VERSION_NAME`/`KEYSTORE_FILE`/`KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`/`KEY_ALIAS`/`KEY_PASSWORD` env vars set by the workflow, falling back to debug signing and static defaults for local builds.

The Settings screen's "Update to latest" button (`feature:settings`'s `SettingsViewModel`/`SettingsScreen`) checks `https://api.github.com/repos/neteinstein/FamilyMoments/releases/latest` (`core:data`'s `GitHubUpdateRepositoryImpl`), compares the tag against the installed `versionName` (`core:domain`'s `isNewerVersion`), and downloads/installs the APK asset via `AppUpdateInstallerImpl` (a `FileProvider`-backed install flow gated by the `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` permission — see `app`'s `AndroidManifest.xml`).

`.github/dependabot.yml` runs weekly `gradle` and `github-actions` update checks.

## Architecture

Gradle multi-module project, wired via `settings.gradle.kts`:

```
app                 # entry point: MainActivity, Application class, Koin DI wiring, navigation graph
core/domain         # pure Kotlin: models, repository interfaces, use cases — no Android/Compose deps
core/data           # repository implementations + data sources, depends on core:domain
core/ui             # shared Compose theme (Color/Theme/Typography), exposes Compose libs via `api`
feature/splash      # splash screen (animated logo, auto-navigates after a delay)
feature/home        # main question-card screen + HomeViewModel (the only feature with a ViewModel so far)
feature/settings    # settings screen (language shortcut to system settings, about section)
```

**Dependency rules (enforced by module graph, not lint):**
- `feature/*` depends only on `core:domain` and `core:ui` — never on another `feature/*` module.
- `core:data` depends on `core:domain` and implements its repository interfaces.
- `core:ui` depends only on Compose/Material3 (no domain/data deps).
- `app` depends on every module and is the only place they're wired together (Koin modules, `NavHost`).

### Data flow (question retrieval)

`QuestionDataSource` (object in `core/data`, `core/data/src/main/kotlin/.../data/source/QuestionDataSource.kt`) holds hardcoded, in-memory question lists per language (`en`, `pt`, `es`, `fr`, `de`) as the single content source — there is no network or persistence layer. `QuestionRepositoryImpl` wraps it and implements `QuestionRepository` (the `core:domain` interface). `GetQuestionsUseCase`/`GetRandomQuestionUseCase` sit on top of the repository interface and are what ViewModels actually call.

Note: `app/src/main/res/xml/locale_config.xml` only declares `en` and `pt` as app locales, even though the data source has content for `es`/`fr`/`de` too — check both places when changing supported languages.

### DI wiring (Koin)

Each module that needs DI defines its own Koin module (`dataModule`, `homeModule`, …); `app/.../di/AppModule.kt` composes them into `appModule`, which `FamilyMomentsApp` (the `Application` subclass) starts via `startKoin`. When adding a feature module with a ViewModel, add its own `*Module.kt` under `feature/<name>/.../di/` and `include` it from `AppModule.kt`.

### Navigation

Single `NavHost` in `app/.../navigation/AppNavigation.kt`, routes defined as a `sealed class Screen` in `Screen.kt` (`Splash`, `Home`, `Settings`). Splash pops itself off the back stack (`popUpTo(inclusive = true)`) once it navigates to Home.

### MVVM conventions

- Each screen that needs state has a `ViewModel` (see `HomeViewModel`) exposing a single `StateFlow<UiState>` (e.g. `HomeUiState`), updated via `MutableStateFlow.update { }`.
- Screens read state with `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`, not `collectAsState()`.
- ViewModels use `viewModelScope`, never `rememberCoroutineScope()`; no `Context` is passed into ViewModels.
- Use cases are single-purpose, named verb+noun (`GetRandomQuestionUseCase`), and injected into ViewModels through Koin `factory { }`.
- `SettingsScreen` currently has no ViewModel — it's a static/stateless screen that delegates to Android system settings for language changes.

### Theming

`FamilyMomentsTheme` (in `core/ui`) picks between Material3 dynamic color (Android 12+/API 31+, via `dynamicLightColorScheme`/`dynamicDarkColorScheme`) and a static `lightColorScheme`/`darkColorScheme` fallback for older devices, based on `isSystemInDarkTheme()`. Never hardcode colors in Composables — always reference `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.*`. All user-facing strings belong in `res/values/strings.xml`.

## Adding a new feature module

1. Create `feature/<name>/` mirroring `feature/home`'s `build.gradle.kts` (depends on `core:domain` + `core:ui` only).
2. Register it in `settings.gradle.kts` and add it as a dependency in `app/build.gradle.kts`.
3. If it needs a ViewModel, add a Koin module under `feature/<name>/.../di/` and `include` it in `app/.../di/AppModule.kt`.
4. Add a route to `Screen.kt` and a `composable(...)` entry in `AppNavigation.kt`.
5. Add unit tests (ViewModel/use case/repository) before opening a PR — see Testing conventions below.

## Testing conventions

- Unit tests use JUnit 4 + MockK (`mockk()`, `coEvery`, `coVerify`) + `kotlinx-coroutines-test`.
- Coroutine-driven tests use `StandardTestDispatcher`, set via `Dispatchers.setMain()`/`resetMain()` in `@Before`/`@After`, and `runTest { }` with `testDispatcher.scheduler.advanceUntilIdle()` to drive pending coroutines.
- Test method names are backtick-quoted sentences: `` fun `nextQuestion advances to next question`() ``.
- Existing tests to use as templates: `core/domain/.../GetRandomQuestionUseCaseTest.kt` (use case + mocked repository) and `feature/home/.../HomeViewModelTest.kt` (ViewModel + mocked use case + coroutine dispatcher setup).

## Agent orchestration

This repo defines four agent roles — Developer, QA, Architect, Security Manager — for both Claude Code subagents (`.claude/agents/`) and GitHub Copilot custom agents (`.github/agents/`). Architect and Security Manager delegate to Developer and QA rather than implementing everything themselves. See [`docs/agents/README.md`](docs/agents/README.md) for the full orchestration model, and `docs/agents/<role>.md` for each role's canonical instructions.
