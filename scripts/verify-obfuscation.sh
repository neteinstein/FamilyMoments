# Why this exists: `isMinifyEnabled`/`isShrinkResources` (androidApp/build.gradle.kts) and the keep rules
# in androidApp/proguard-rules.pro can regress silently - a stray blanket `-keep`, or minification being
# switched off - and the build still succeeds, so only the mapping file shows what R8 actually
# did. Reading it here turns "obfuscation is on and Room still resolves" into a PR gate.
